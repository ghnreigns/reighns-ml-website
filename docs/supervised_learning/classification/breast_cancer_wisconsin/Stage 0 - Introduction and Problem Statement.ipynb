    "In our context, we are presented with a dataset that are taken from a biopsy procedure called **Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA)** performed on the breast. The tissue taken from the biopsy will then be sent to a lab and be examined by a pathologist, a report will be written if cancerous cells are spotted or not and be sent to the specialist to further explain the results to the patient. However, there may be [disagreements](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-biopsy/about/pac-20384812) whereby the pathologist report shows there are no signs of cancerous cells, while radiologist may disagree as he/she might find suspicious lesions from the mammogram/CT/MRI scans. This can happen if the biopsy taken is only on the benign cells and if there is dispute, a more thorough of biopsy may be performed again.\n",

Instead, we develop models to aid their understanding, and also to come up with a more systematic benchmark for one to refer to. More concretely, the dataset has features that are computed from a digitized image from **FNA**, and each observation describes statistics/characteristics of the cell nucleus. There are 10 base features, and 3 different measurements are taken for each feature, namely, the **mean, standard error and the \"worst/largest\"**. One thing to note is that **worst** means the **mean of the three largest values**.\n",

If we need to explain our model to our business stakeholders, then it is a good idea to choose a model that can be interpreted well, models like Logistic Regression with Lasso may be a good choice as the model itself has better interpretation, and with lasso we can reduce the number of features. If we only care about our model's ability to predict, then interpretability may not be so important and we may choose a model that performs well, but the weights may be more difficult to understand. </p>\n",
