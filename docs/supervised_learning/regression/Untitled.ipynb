    "# Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first start off by constructing the Simple Linear Regression (SLR).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{price} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{sqft} + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\\beta_1$ the coefficient and $\\epsilon$ is the error term. The error term can be thought of as the errors in the random universe, and makes up for the deviations in the model that cannot be prevented, we will not touch too much on the $\\epsilon$ and will take it as the difference between the predicted and true values which are not being explained by the variables $x$ in the SLR model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the intercept term the regression line would always have to pass through the origin, which is almost never an optimal way to represent the relationship between our target and predictor variable. This concept is closely linked to the reason why a model must always have a bias term. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Bias: If there is no bias term in the model, you will lose the flexibility of your model. Imagine a simple linear regression model without a bias term, then your linear equation $y=mx$ will only pass through the origin. Therefore, if your underlying data (pretend that we know that the underlying data's actual function $y = 3x + 5$), then your Linear Regression model will never find the \"best fit line\" simply because we already assume that our prediction is governed by the slope $m$, and there does not exist our $c$, the intercept/bias term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is usually the case whereby we always add in an intercept term. We intend to estimate the values of $y$ ***given*** $x$. Each value of $x$ is multiplied by $\\beta_{1}$, with a constant intercept term $\\beta_{0}$. We end this section by knowing that 1 unit increase in $x$ will correspond to a $\\beta_1$ unit increase in $y$ according to the model, while always remebering to add the intercept term.\n",

    "## Conditional Mean and Expectation\n",
    "\n",
    "Something that most formal textbooks will mention is that a linear regression model is predicted via a conditional expectation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(y|x)=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the probability model underlying linear regression, X and Y *are* random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "> if so, as an example, if Y = obesity and X = age, if we take the conditional expectation $E(Y|X=35)$ meaning, whats the expected value of being obese if the individual is 35 across the sample, we just take the average(arithmetic mean) of y for those observations where X=35?\n",
    "\n",
    "But this means that each yi has in principle a different expected value : so the yi's here do not come from an identically distributed population. If they don't, then our sample {Y,X}, that contains as a random variable only the Y is not \"random\" (i.e. it is not i.i.d), due to the assumption that the X's are deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "So given a prediction vector y hat, this set of y hat (note not just single prediction) gives rise to the lowest L2 Loss, note again, this \"unique\" set of y hat will give rise to the lowest L2 loss. Now, this set of y hat is also the conditional mean of y given the training set X, technically, say our yhat[0] = 2.3, then this means, the corresponding X[0], say 1.5 (only 1 feature), is corresponding to this point 2.3, and this means on average, points residing with the input x = 1.5, will give an expectation value of 2.3. Now, if we go to yhat[1] = 3.3, with X[1] = 1.8, then the same logic applies.\n",

    "## Function to predict y\n",

    "An simple formula that predicts the value of the house ($\\hat{y}$) given input variable square feet ($x$) is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no more error terms $\\epsilon$ and rightfully so, because if our model can know the unknown errors, it will be a perfect model, however, in reality, this SLR is just an estimation of $y$.\n",

    "## Function of Residuals\n",
    "\n",

    "This is important to understand. Informally, we call this RSS, whereby it is a function $J(\\beta)$ that we want to minimize on. We usually call $J(\\beta)$ the loss function, as we want to minimize the loss. Slightly more formally, we can say that we want to find the optimal $\\beta$ that gives rise to the minimum of $f = \\text{RSS}$. Mathematically, we express this as $\\text{argmin}_{\\beta \\in \\R}J(\\beta)$. We will touch on this later in Multiple Linear Regression, where a more rigorous form is being presented, and talking about its global minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In other words, we want to find the** $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ such that, $J(\\beta)$ is at a minimum. We choose a reasonable function $J(\\beta)$ to be the Residual Sum of Squared Error. We will solve for $J(\\beta)$ and get the best $\\beta$ so that our predicted $\\hat{y}$ will be as close to the ground truth $y$ as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of now, we denote our loss function $J(\\beta)$ as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$J(\\beta)=\\sum(y-\\hat{y})^2=\\sum(y-\\beta_0-\\beta_1x)^2 = \\text{RSS}=\\text{SSR}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we chose such a function is because of its convexity, and of course, that it is also the well known Ordinary Least Squares Estimator of $\\beta$.  In addition, why the squared residuals instead of just the absolute value of the residuals? Well, both can be used – absolute value of residuals is often used when there are large outliers or other abnormalities in variables. [Solving for the least absolute deviations (LAD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_absolute_deviations) is a type of \"robust\" regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In High School Calculus, we recall that to find a minimum of a function $J(\\beta)$, we take the derivative and set it to 0. We do the exact same thing here:\n",

In statistics, we often call $\\beta$ as the **true population parameter**, but in reality, we do not have knowledge of what the underlying **parameter** is, and therefore we minimize the loss function to find the best estimate for the true population parameter $\\beta$, we denote it as $\\hat{\\beta}$ and call it a **statistics**.\n",

    "## Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that is worth highlighting is I did a simple standardization of the $y$ value through a division of 1000. Therefore, our predicted SLR model says that given a constant intercept of $71 \\times 1000 = 71000$, we expect that every unit increase of square feet brings about an increase of price of $0.135 \\times 1000 = 135$ dollars. In other words, if you were to purchase a house which is $100$ square feet more than your current house, be ready to fork out an additional $13500$ bucks. (Hmm, kinda cheap though 😂, my country Singapore has way higher housing price than this 😐)\n",
    "\n",
    "We also can calculate the loss function, or preferably the Residual Sum of Squares (SSR), to be $193464$. Note that this is the lowest number that this model can get, although it seems high, but mathematically, there does not exist a number smaller than the aforementioned, solely because we already minimized the loss function to its global minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### R-Squared\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't leave SLR without discussing the most notable metrics to access the model's performance called **[R-Squared](https://blog.minitab.com/en/adventures-in-statistics-2/regression-analysis-how-do-i-interpret-r-squared-and-assess-the-goodness-of-fit)**. Although in all seriousness, it may no longer be the \"best\" metric due to the following two reasons from [Reference from Minitab](https://blog.minitab.com/en/adventures-in-statistics-2/multiple-regession-analysis-use-adjusted-r-squared-and-predicted-r-squared-to-include-the-correct-number-of-variables#:~:text=The%20adjusted%20R%2Dsquared%20is,less%20than%20expected%20by%20chance.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every time you add a predictor to a model, the R-squared increases, even if due to chance alone. It never decreases. Consequently, a model with more terms may appear to have a better fit simply because it has more terms.\n",
    "2. If a model has too many predictors and higher order polynomials, it begins to model the random noise in the data. This condition is known as [overfitting the model](https://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics/the-danger-of-overfitting-regression-models) and it produces misleadingly high R-squared values and a lessened ability to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we are still going to go through the motion and discuss it. **(Reference from Minitab.)**\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of R-squared is fairly straight-forward; it is the percentage of the response variable variation that is explained by a linear model → R-squared = Explained variation / Total variation\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is always between 0 and 100% where\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean.\n",
    "- 100% indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the higher the R-squared, the better the model fits your data. But do remember that the more predictors you add to a LR model, the R-Squared will going to increase regardless.\n",

Remember the dataset on house pricing? We just now used the most obvious one to predict the **price of a house**, given the predictor variable , **square feet.** However, there are two other variables, **number of bedrooms** and **age of the house**. We can instead model these two variables alongside with **square feet** to predict the **price** of the house. In general, if these variables all play a crucial role in affecting the **price** of the house, then including these 3 variables will make the model more accurate. However, we have to take note of a few **important assumptions** of MLR (SLR included). We will mention it here.\n",

    "[Reference]: [Linear Regression Assumptions by Jeff Macaluso from Microsoft](https://jeffmacaluso.github.io/post/LinearRegressionAssumptions/)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Assumptions of Linear Regression](https://jeffmacaluso.github.io/post/LinearRegressionAssumptions/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Linearity**\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes that there is a linear relationship between the predictors (e.g. independent variables or features) and the response variable (e.g. dependent variable or label). This also assumes that the predictors are additive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it can happen:** There may not just be a linear relationship among the data. Modeling is about trying to estimate a function that explains a process, and linear regression would not be a fitting estimator (pun intended) if there is no linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it will affect:** The predictions will be extremely inaccurate because our model is [underfitting](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1125/1*_7OPgojau8hkiPUiHoGK_w.png). This is a serious violation that should not be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to detect it:** If there is only one predictor, this is pretty easy to test with a scatter plot. Most cases aren’t so simple, so we’ll have to modify this by using a scatter plot to see our predicted values versus the actual values (in other words, view the residuals). Ideally, the points should lie on or around a diagonal line on the scatter plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to fix it:** Either adding polynomial terms to some of the predictors or applying nonlinear transformations . If those do not work, try adding additional variables to help capture the relationship between the predictors and the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Homoscedasticity**\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes homoscedasticity, which is the same **variance** within our error terms. Heteroscedasticity, the violation of homoscedasticity, occurs when we don’t have an even **variance** across the error terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it can happen:** Our model may be giving too much weight to a subset of the data, particularly where the error variance was the largest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it will affect:** Significance tests for coefficients due to the standard errors being biased. Additionally, the confidence intervals will be either too wide or too narrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to detect it:** Plot the residuals and see if the variance appears to be uniform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to fix it:** Heteroscedasticity (can you tell I like the *scedasticity* words?) can be solved either by using [weighted least squares regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares#Weighted_least_squares) instead of the standard OLS or transforming either the dependent or highly skewed variables. Performing a log transformation on the dependent variable is not a bad place to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normality of the Error Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, this assumes that the error terms of the model are **normally distributed**. Linear regressions other than [Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares) may also assume normality of the predictors or the label, but that is not the case here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it can happen:** This can actually happen if either the predictors or the label are significantly non-normal. Other potential reasons could include the linearity assumption being violated or outliers affecting our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it will affect:** A violation of this assumption could cause issues with either shrinking or inflating our confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to detect it:** There are a variety of ways to do so, but we’ll look at both a histogram and the p-value from the Anderson-Darling test for normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to fix it:** It depends on the root cause, but there are a few options. Nonlinear transformations of the variables, excluding specific variables (such as long-tailed variables), or removing outliers may solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **No Autocorrelation between Error Terms**\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes no autocorrelation of the error terms. Autocorrelation being present typically indicates that we are missing some information that should be captured by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it can happen:** In a time series scenario, there could be information about the past that we aren’t capturing. In a non-time series scenario, our model could be systematically biased by either under or over predicting in certain conditions. Lastly, this could be a result of a violation of the linearity assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it will affect:** This will impact our model estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to detect it:** We will perform a [Durbin-Watson test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durbin%E2%80%93Watson_statistic) to determine if either positive or negative correlation is present. Alternatively, you could create plots of residual autocorrelations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to fix it:** A simple fix of adding lag variables can fix this problem. Alternatively, interaction terms, additional variables, or additional transformations may fix this.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multicollinearity among Predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes that the predictors used in the regression are not correlated with each other. This won’t render our model unusable if violated, but it will cause issues with the interpretability of the model. This is why in the previous section, we need to make sure that the 3 variables, **square feet, number of bedrooms, age of house** are not highly correlated with each other, else additive effects may happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it can happen:** A lot of data is just naturally correlated. For example, if trying to predict a house price with square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms, we can expect to see correlation between those three variables because bedrooms and bathrooms make up a portion of square footage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it will affect:** Multicollinearity causes issues with the interpretation of the coefficients. Specifically, you can interpret a coefficient as “an increase of 1 in this predictor results in a change of (coefficient) in the response variable, holding all other predictors constant.” This becomes problematic when multicollinearity is present because we can’t hold correlated predictors constant. Additionally, it increases the standard error of the coefficients, which results in them potentially showing as statistically insignificant when they might actually be significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to detect it:** There are a few ways, but we will use a heatmap of the correlation as a visual aid and examine the [variance inflation factor (VIF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_inflation_factor).\n",

This can be confirmed by `house.bdrms.value_counts().`One unit increase of $x_2$ means one more bedroom, which signifies a decrease of $8621$ in the price of the house.

In the SLR setting, we are often interested in learning about the population intercept $\\beta_0$ and the population slope $β_1$.

Note that $0$ is a common benchmark we use in linear regression, but it, in fact can be any number. This is why we have to draw **inferences** from $\\hat{β}_1$ to make substantiate conclusion on the true population slope $β_1$.\n",

This might be hard to reconcile at first, but if we see the formula of the t-statistics, and that by definition we set*** $\\beta_H=0$, then it is apparent that if $t_{\\hat{\\beta}}=0$, it forces the formula to become $t_{\\hat{\\beta}}=0=\\dfrac{\\hat{\\beta}-0}{\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta})} \\Longrightarrow \\hat{\\beta}=0$ ; even more concretely with an example, we replace $\\beta_{H}$ with our favorite **true population parameter** $\\beta_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$ with $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, then it just means that if $\\beta_1$ were really $0$, i.e. no relationship of $y$ and $x_1$, and if we also get $t_{\\hat{\\beta}_1}$to be 0 as well (To re-explain this part as a bit cumbersome). ***In which case we accept the null hypothesis; on the other hand, if our t-value is none-zero, it means that*** $\\hat{\\beta}_1≠0$***)***\n",

    "## **Orthogonalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can speed up the Normal Equation’s time complexity by using a technique called Orthogonalization, whereby we make use of [QR Factorization](http://mlwiki.org/index.php/QR_Factorization) so we do not need to invert the annoying $X^TX$ where it took n³ time!\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Regularization**\n",
    "\n",
    "You basically cannot leave Linear Models without knowing L1–2 Regularization! The Ridge, Lasso, and the ElasticNet! Note that Regularization is a broad term that traverses through all Machine Learning Models. Stay tuned on understanding how Regularization can reduce overfitting. In addition, one caveat that I didn’t mention is what if $X^TX$ is not invertible in our Normal Equation? This can happen if some columns of X are linearly dependent (redundancy in our feature variables), or there are too many features whereby somehow… the number of training samples m is lesser than the number of features n. If you use say, Ridge Regression, then the Modified Normal Equation guarantees a solution. We will talk about it in Part II of Linear Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Statistical and Interpretation of Linear Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "I didn’t mention much about how to interpret Linear Regression. This is important, even if you know how to code up a Linear Regression Algorithm from scratch, if you do not know how to interpret the results in a statistically rigorous way, then that is not meaningful! Learn more on Hypothesis Testing, Standard Errors, and Confidence Levels. I may delve a bit on Maximum Likelihood Estimators as well!\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion on what I learnt in this few days:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Returning `self` by method chaining.\n",
    "2. Using Decorators in Python where I have to call `raise xxx error` multiple times throughout the classes, which is annoying. Reference from [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24024966/try-except-every-method-in-class). And [Real Python](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/).\n",

    "- Take input $X$ and $y$ → Use either closed form solution or Gradient Descent. And remember $y = X\\beta$, use this everywhere for vectorization.\n",
    "- Gradient Descent\n",
    "    1. Define Cost Function to be MSE = $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2$\n",
    "    2. In order to compute the gradient, we can vectorize it as such: $\\nabla$MSE = $-\\frac{2}{N}(y_{true} - y_{pred}) @ X$; This is because y_true - y_pred gives you a 1xN vector, whereby X gives you a N x (n+1) vector. Multiplying them give us 1x(n+1) vector, which is the gradient vector of MSE, looks like $[\\beta_0, \\beta_1, ..., \\beta_n]$. Note $\\sum_{i=1}^{N}$is omitted due to vectorizing.\n",
    "    3. Note `y_pred` is calculated by `X @ B`\n",
    "    4. Question: Verify by hand that the above gradient vector is true and derive it by calculus.\n",
