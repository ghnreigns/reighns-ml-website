# General

1. Write a reading for each topic. See linear regression notebook.
2. To refer to dafriedman etc's notes on regression and ML models.
3. To check how to upload objects to gcp.
4. To make type hinting more accurate, rename variables, especially say the `optimize` function in Stage 7, hints are poorly made.

# Metrics

1. Add decision threshold section precision_recall_f1.
2. To add more rigour to roc_pr_curve and cohens' kappa when the time arrives (especially do in conjunction with a project)!
3. To visit scripts in reighns_MLAlgorithms and make them correspond to my notes here.
4. #TODO: In multiclass_roc_auc_score change y_score to y_prob. See metrics.py in cassava.
5. To add Calibration Curves - see sklearn and other good examples: links below
